## What is [EvalAI](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI)?

EvalAI is an open source web application that helps researchers, students and data-scientists to create, collaborate and participate in various AI challenges organized round the globe.

In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable & accurate quantitative analysis. By providing swift and robust backends based on map-reduce frameworks that speed up evaluation on the fly, EvalAI aims to make it easier for researchers to reproduce results from technical papers and perform reliable and accurate analyses.


## What is the [EvalAI-CLI](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI-CLI)?

EvalAI CLI was designed to extend the functionality of the EvalAI web app to the command line. EvalAI CLI offers you most of the core features of the EvalAI web app on your termial, enabling you to keep the efficiency of working on a terminal, from make a submission to viewing the results of a competition without ever leaving the terminal. EvalAI CLI is cross-platform supported and is available of PyPI.
